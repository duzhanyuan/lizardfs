Example:
 mfsmount -o cacheexpirationtime=1000 -o readaheadmaxwindowsize=8192

Example:
 lizardfs rremove big_directory/

Tools for managing tasks
Two administration tools are available for managing long tasks:
 lizardfs-admin list-tasks

Run above commands for detailed usage information.

Secondary groups support
LizardFS is now able to fully recognize secondary groups of users
and take them into account while evaluating permissions.
